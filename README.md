# JMDb
Source code for a Movie Trailer website project for the Udacity Full Stack
Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Summary
This project was written by Jonathan Broderick in April 2017.

This is a simple website where a user can view a list of movies and click on a
particular movie to see a trailer from that movie.

## Contents
This project is made up of three files:
  - `media.py`  A class called 'Movie' is defined here.
  - `entertainment_center.py`  Instances of class 'Movie' are defined here, and
   the `open_movies_page()` function is called at the end.
  - `fresh_tomatoes.py`  The HTML and `open_movies_page()` function are defined
   here.

## Requirements
The Python used in this project was version 2.7.13. If you're having issues
running this code with another version, download this version
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and try it again.

## Usage
If you would like to make changes to the code or simply use the website, follow
these steps:
  1. Fork this repo and/or download the zip file.
  2. If you want to change what movies are shown on the site, you only need to
  change the `entertainment_center.py` file. If you simply want to see
  the site as-is, right-click on that same file and edit it with IDLE (this
    comes with Python).
  3. Then either hit F5 or, at the top of the window, click
    'Run' and then click 'Run Module'.

This will create an HTML file in the same directory as the `.py` files and will
 open the JMDb page in a browser.
